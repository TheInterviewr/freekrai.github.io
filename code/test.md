> Apple warns against “running to the press” saying that it “never helps,” but we all know that it does help. And developers will continue to do it because Apple’s suggested channel of communicating doesn’t work. 

And it’s even worse for the *vast* majority of iOS and Mac developers who *don’t* have any Apple contacts or developer-relations representatives. You don’t just get an Apple rep when you sign up — you just need to wait until, hopefully, one contacts you, then you hold onto that email address.
